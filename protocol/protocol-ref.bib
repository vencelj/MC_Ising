	ABSTRACT = {An exact solution of the Ising model on the simple cubic lattice is one of the long-standing open problems in rigorous statistical mechanics. Indeed, it is generally believed that settling it would constitute a methodological breakthrough, fomenting great prospects for further application, similarly to what happened when Lars Onsager solved the two-dimensional model eighty years ago. Hence, there have been many attempts to find analytic expressions for the exact partition function Z, but all such attempts have failed due to unavoidable conceptual or mathematical obstructions. Given the importance of this simple yet paradigmatic model, here we set out clear-cut criteria for any claimed exact expression for Z to be minimally plausible. Specifically, we present six necessary—but not sufficient—conditions that Z must satisfy. These criteria will allow very quick plausibility checks of future claims. As illustrative examples, we discuss previous mistaken “solutions”, unveiling their shortcomings.},

	ABSTRACT = {Using a single-site mean-field approximation (MFA) and Monte Carlo simulations, we examine Ising-like models on directed regular random graphs. The models are directed-network implementations of the Ising model, Ising model with absorbing states, and majority voter models. When these nonequilibrium models are driven by the heat-bath dynamics, their stationary characteristics, such as magnetization, are correctly reproduced by MFA as confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations. It turns out that MFA reproduces the same result as the generating functional analysis that is expected to provide the exact description of such models. We argue that on directed regular random graphs, the neighbors of a given vertex are typically uncorrelated, and that is why MFA for models with heat-bath dynamics provides their exact description. For models with Metropolis dynamics, certain additional correlations become relevant, and MFA, which neglects these correlations, is less accurate. Models with heat-bath dynamics undergo continuous phase transition, and at the critical point, the power-law time decay of the order parameter exhibits the behavior of the Ising mean-field universality class. Analogous phase transitions for models with Metropolis dynamics are discontinuous.},
